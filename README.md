Hi, chaisebasse is just a nickname, my real name is Ermanno !
I'm currently an undergrad student at Universit√© Paris Nanterre in a double degree in Economics/Management and Mathematics/Computer Science üñ•Ô∏è
I'm always looking for a mentor more experienced than me, especially in C and low level programming, to help me in my learning.
I'm also kind of always looking for 2 months internships around May-June each year, so if you know someone that could help me with that, try contacting me at 42003524@parisnanterre.fr ! If I don't answer to your emails, I'm either not intersted or really busy...
And as chatGPT often says :
Happy coding !
